# networking_c++
This is my first interaction with networking sockets with cpp, I have created and tested server and client side in c++ in the same pc.

I had a two diffeante visual studio projects open, you can see the photo of the end resoult of running both at the same time in the repository.

I will work on this subject, my next step would be to add multithreading so that server will be able to answear few clients at the time.
after that I will write android application for the client side and will make a mini project around it. stay tuned...
